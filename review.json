Since this is a gaming laptop the keyboard can have different colored lights.  The gaming keys, qwerasdf are reverse lighted, so if I am typing in the dark it is good but in light it can be difficult to see the keys.  Durability has been good.  I carry it in a padded computer bag.  It has a good weight so if you are looking for a light weight computer this would not be good.  Cooling is very good for a gaming laptop.  I can keep the laptop on my legs without it getting really hot.  Design and layout is good.  Monitor connection to based looks very good.

        "text": "Vengo de una Asus TUF A15 Ryzen 7 con una RTX 3050/16GB de RAM. Esta Rog G16 i7 RTX4060/16 GB RAM la supera por bastante.La laptop me llego en perfectas condiciones, sin backlight bleeding ni problemas en la tarjeta grafica. Tampoco el famoso ‚Äúcoil whine‚Äù.La pantalla representa mucho mejor el color y da un poco m√°s brillo que una laptop gamer de gama baja. Bocinas decentes con cierto bass a mi parecer, unas dos rayitas m√°s de volumen y es perfecta.La sensaci√≥n del teclado y la construcci√≥n general de esta laptop es superior a lo com√∫n.Juegos AAA me los corre excelente. Entre 40fps(high/ultra) a 80fps(medium). En donde se vuelven notables los ventiladores pero tienen un sonido que a mi parecer es acostumbrable.En tareas b√°sicas en Adobe e internet es realmente silenciosa y no se calienta.En cuanto a programas de renderizado como referencia de una RTX3050 mobile me tardaban 15 seg por renders, Esta RTX4060 me tarda no m√°s de 6 seg. (Renderizo mobiliario urbano)En cuanto a la entrega tengo la teor√≠a que me la abri√≥ la aduana porque la caja ven√≠a con el sello cortado pero todo bien.Es un poco m√°s pesada que una laptop gamer b√°sica, me he adaptado bien, sin embargo es algo que notar√°s.Update: La laptop no ha presentado mayor problema. Sin embargo despu√©s de unos meses de transportandola ya me present√≥ backlight bleeding ligero. Lo considero normal dado el uso que le doy. Mi recomendaci√≥n es que la transporten con cuidado.Read more",
