So I had to uninstall the CPU, grab my old CPU. Then realize my old AMD CPU was stuck to the heatsink...now I have to spend 45 minutes melting the old CPU's thermal paste with a hair dryer (something I vowed never to do...but, desperate times...), put it back in my motherboard after finally getting it off, get extremely frustrated trying to install the new heatsink I bought over my old CPU cause the screws weren't lining up, haul it back to my desk and plug all my cables back in when I finished, look up what BIOS version I needed, find a USB drive that was actually FAT32, download the file, boot to BIOS and do the Instant Flash, wait for 10 minutes, praying that the power didn't go out and fry my motherboard...then when it was finally done I got into YET ANOTHER boot loop after the BIOS was updated.

        "text": "This is a great price for this CPU, and a serious contender if you're going to be buying a discrete GPU and building your own PC. Ryzen 7 5700X offers great base speeds with lots of cache on 8 cores, and will happily accept some tweaking and overclocking. Some folks have worried about CPU bottlenecking with higher-end GPUs, but this works very well with a 7900XTX, and bottlenecking is only going to be an issue with huge GPU demand and a lot of back-end processes or demand placed on the CPU. Cyberpunk 2077 in 4k at 200fps? Easy. This is a GREAT mid-range CPU, and the L3 cache (one of AMD's cornerstones) is the same as most of the 7000 series Ryzen processors.However, with it not being a flagship model, most lower- and many mid-ranged motherboards may not support the chip straight out of the box. But don't let that deter you..... If you opt for a motherboard like mine (MSI) and face a similar issue - needing to update firmware/BIOS - don't worry. Follow the video guides on YouTube and in manuals and you'll be fine. But remember: format a new, small USB2 drive in FAT32, Google is your friend for this and for checking a partition is MBR (if you're very particular), download the exact version of BIOS required, and rename the file AND extension as directed. If you then boot from a Windows Installation Media drive, you'll get a fresh install of Windows without any bloatware or rootkits from any device manufacturer!Very easy to install - be gentle and cautious (and consider an antistatic wristband), line up the triangles, and don't force anything. Stability is a proven strength, and Ryzen Master is a good monitoring tool; the CPU voltage remains constant after idling for several hours with core temperature peaking at 30°C. Make sure you apply the thermal paste evenly, making sure to avoid leaving a blank spot. Appearance-wise? It's a chip. In an unnecessarily large box.Clean install of Windows 11 and up-and-running in less than an hour. Don't forget this chip DOESN'T HAVE INTEGRATED GRAPHICS AND DOESN'T COME WITH A STOCK COOLER, but let the CPU do CPU things and invest in a GPU of your choice. Plus, if you're opting for a CPU without integrated graphics, you'll probably be doing something with the cooling, right?As others have said (and this review highlighted previously), there must be some issue with the Amazon/seller/logistics/delivery process. I had multiple notifications about updates to tracking, but nothing informative on the Amazon platform. I was told, multiple times, that it had been dispatched, or tracking information was available, which did cause me some distress and confusion when seeing other reviews. I strongly suspect there's some issue between the vendor's platform, Amazon, tracking/delivery service, and how their systems speak to each other.Read more",

        "text": "Der Ryzen 7 5700X ist für mich aktuell einer der besten Deals, wenn es um starke Allround-Leistung im AM4-Sockel geht. 8 Kerne, 16 Threads, und dabei eine sehr gute Effizienz – perfekt für Gaming, Streaming und auch produktive Aufgaben wie Video- oder Fotobearbeitung.In Spielen steht der 5700X kaum teureren CPUs nach, vor allem wenn man eine halbwegs aktuelle Grafikkarte nutzt. Und wer multithreaded Anwendungen nutzt, bekommt hier richtig was fürs Geld. Die Temperaturen sind auch angenehm niedrig – selbst mit einem Mittelklasse-Luftkühler läuft er schön kühl und leise.Ein kleines Extra: Kein Boxed-Kühler dabei – aber das finde ich sogar gut, weil man sich sowieso meist einen besseren Kühler gönnt. Und die CPU ließ sich bei mir ohne große Mühe leicht übertakten.Fazit: Wer noch auf AM4 setzt oder aufrüstet, macht mit dem 5700X nichts falsch. Starke Performance, gute Effizienz, zukunftssicher für viele Jahre – absolute Empfehlung!Read more",
